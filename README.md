For this project I will be looking into dark patterns from the Princeton Web Crawl data set. To futher understand dark patterns and the elvel of deception. I understand the ethical concerns of dark patterns deceving users and putting them into unwanted situtaions, risking the users automony. In the Final Project Paper a more in depth report will be in it.
